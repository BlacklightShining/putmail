In case of problems

First off, read the FAQ (at doc/FAQ or in the system's putmail.py
documentation directory). Your question may be answered there. Then,
check your putmail.py setup and try any possible valid configuration
variants.

If that doesn't help, please drop me an e-mail about the problem. My
contact information can be found at http://sourceforge.net/users/rg3/.
Please attach or paste any system files that may be relevant to the
