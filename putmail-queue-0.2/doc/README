This is my first try at providing a queuing system for putmail.py. 
Inside, you'll find two programs: putmail_enqueue.py and 
putmail_dequeue.py.

To use them, you must first create the directory $HOME/.putmail/queue/. 
It's recommended that only you have access to it.

Install the program by running install.sh as root if necessary.
Optionally, edit the file first to specify destination directories.

Usage instructions are in the man page. Use "man putmail-queue" to
read it. It is a recommended one-time read.
